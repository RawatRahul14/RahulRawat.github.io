![Data Science](/images/coding_image.png){: .align-right width="300px"}
📘 I'm a final-year postgraduate student at Lambton College.

🚀 My interests lie in data science, machine learning, and AI-driven solutions.

🤖 I'm currently diving into Generative AI, expanding my skills in the latest AI technologies.

🔍 I'm passionate about solving real-world problems through data analysis and predictive modeling.


## 🌟 My Goals & Aspirations

As I near the completion of my postgraduate studies, I am eager to apply my skills in real-world AI applications. My long-term goal is to become a leader in AI-driven solutions, working on projects that have a meaningful impact on society.

## Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers

I have a strong interest in reimplementing and reproducing academic papers to better understand cutting-edge algorithms and techniques in the field of AI and data science. By reworking these research papers, I aim to gain hands-on experience with advanced concepts and contribute to the broader scientific community by improving and optimizing existing solutions.

Some of the papers I have worked on include:
* [Attention is all You need](https://github.com/RawatRahul14/Attention-is-all-you-need)
  * I reproduced the Transformer model from "Attention Is All You Need" using NumPy and PyTorch. By implementing the self-attention mechanism and other key components, I gained hands-on experience with the architecture and its impact on NLP tasks.
